This application was built using the defaults from the [Phoenix Framework](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/up_and_running.html).  Thanks for all those maintainer's work!

I use this repository to test out technical problems and work on new ideas.  It is currently hosted on Gigalixir but I plan on moving this to AWS as a containerized application. The latest feature I am working on is adding an interactive API client to show more of the Phoenix Live View features, as well as, the power of the OTP.
